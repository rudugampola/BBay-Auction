REQUEST Data: The data is extracted from the database and must be serialized into a JSON dump. The data is saved to a text file named 'data.txt' located within the same folder as the microservice. The 'type' can be defined as profits, expenses, or sales to enable proper labeling for the charts.
<code>
profitsJSON = (JsonResponse({'data': list(data), 'type': 'profits'}))
# Write the JSON object to a file
with open('auctions/graphs/data.txt', 'w+') as f:
    f.write(expensesJSON.content.decode('utf-8'))
</code>
<p>
RECEIVE Data: 
The chart generated from the data will be saved at the same location as the microservice. The chart can be read as binary and displayed on a HTML page.  
    </p>

import base64

with open('auctions/graphs/graph.png', 'rb') as image_file:
    image = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')
